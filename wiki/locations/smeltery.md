Built by [Razvii](../people/razvii.md) to facilitate the mass-production of baked goods, the smeltery is one of the oldest, and most reliable, peices of infrastructure on the [Minecraft](../games/minecraft.md) server.

# Location

# Operation
The smeltery has three modes, selected from a control valve in the foyer.

## **Manual**

In manual mode, unprocessed goods are injected into the smeltery from a user-accessible barrel placed immediately adjacent to [route 1](route1.md). For reasons related directly and *only* to security, it is strictly forbidden for OSHA to be given access to this barrel. Manual mode is indicated with an amber light.

Processed products are deposited into a second barrel adjacent to the input.

## **Automatic**

In automatic mode, the input and output of goods and products is handled directly by route 1. Automatic mode is indicated with a green light.

## **Disabled**

When the smeltery is disabled, it does not process goods. This mode is indicated with a red light.

## **Train access**

The smeltery acts as the terminus for route 1. Like much of route 1, the smeltery terminus is compromised by its geography. Being attatched to the side of coastal mountain, the smeltry terminus lacks space for a turning loop; trains entering and leaving the smeltery must use a reversing siding to re-orient themselves after departing. The capacity of said siding sets a hard-limit on the maximum length of trains using route 1.
