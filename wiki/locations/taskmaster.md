Taskmaster is a mighty stone monument sculpted in the likeness of a turtle and often thought to be divine. Its purpose is to guide the workforce, delegating labour between [Rav](../people/razvii.md), [Brent](../people/brent.md), and [Jeremy](../people/jeremy.md) at the begining of each stream. As streams ended, tasks would need to be reported either complete or incomplete, at which point Taskmasterwould deem labourers either disapointing or not disapointing. Scores awarded based on a labourer's performance were used to track the quality of their contributions to the server.

# Task Evasion

>"The difference between task avoidance and task evasion is the thickness of a prison wall."

Though on paper, using a spreadhseet algorithm to catagorise and distribute tasks is a perfect system, in practice there were complications. Since catagorisation was based on a complexity scoring system, tasks could be purposely designed such that they acheive the maximum complexity score while necessatiating the minimum workload. Thus was created task evasion.
