# Old Workshop

The old workshop is a much smaller structure, built on the river waterfront into the side of a brick wall. Due to its low speed and throughput, the old workshop often struggled to keep up with the compound's manufacturing and material demmand, eventually prompting the construction of a much larger worksop.
