The Panopticon is an all-seeing omnipresent eyesore that hangs in the sky like a colossal blot of ink seeping through clouds as though they were fine stock paper.
Constructed by Raz, the Panopticon was initially designed to act as a command station for his turtles and automoatons; it's potential, however, was never realised - owing to an
insightful and fortuatous bet placed by Jeremy.

# Gamba

Once upon a time there was a Razvii. This Razvii liked to gamble. So overcome by gambling was he, that every opportunity would be taken to place a bet. Every chance, every game, every decision - and a wager would be placed. One day, he thought, his habbit would pay dividends. During these times, the Razvii had built many a great wonder; chief among them being a mighty station, grasping the heavens at the border of the sky. From his station, he could see all - and see all he did. He looked out to the mountains. He looked north to the sea. East to the foundry, and down to the forests thick with trees. But what he saw in those forests filled him with a terrible envy. Every day, between the trunks and the leaves, a small train would pass. Crawling through the undergrowth and scaling the hills, it was in the Razvii's view and he wanted it. So he hatched a scheme. "Jeremy" he said "with your train so magnificent. Would you care for a game?" For a moment, Jeremy thought. He knew the Razvii liked to gamble, and he knew where this would lead. "Razvii" said Jeremy, looking to the sea "I'll take your wager, but what's in it for me?." "Well what would you want?" asked the Razvii, with a glint in his eye. "Your station" said Jeremy "up there in the sky." Consumed by his lust, the Razvii pressed on "and under what terms would I make such a bet?". Jeremy pondered, then turned to the sea. "The local Brent left port last week. Niether you, nor I, have heard from him since. We are set to assemble in town tonight - I bet he will return before then." "Jeremy you fool!" The Razvii exclaimed with a grin. "He will never return, surely I will win! I've watched that Brent every time he departs, he never sticks to a schedule, he wanders too far." So sure was the Razvii of his odds that no attempt was even made for negotiation. With utmost confidence he accepted the odds. The two waited in silence, as time drew short. The Razvii turned to Jeremy, that grin still on his face. But just before the dedline, a boat drifted to shore. Out stepped the local Brent, to Razvii's surprise. And just like that, he lost his station in the skies.

Remember kids, 99.9% of gamblers quit just before they hit it big.
