The Panopticon is an all-seeing omnipresent eyesore that hangs in the sky like a colossal blot of ink seeping through clouds as though they were fine stock paper.
Constructed by Raz, the Panopticon was initially designed to act as a command station for his turtles and automoatons; it's potential, however, was never realised - owing to an
insightful and fortuatous bet placed by Jeremy.
