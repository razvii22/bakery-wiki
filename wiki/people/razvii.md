# Characteristics

Origins of the Raz are unknown so far. What is known is that this creature is not of anthropomorphic origin. He might look human, but looks often deceive. His looks could perchance draw you in closer with the promise of a good time. But once close enough, you will get devoured mentally, leaving nothing but a hollow husk behind.

# Hobbies

Raz's free time is spent managing the Twitch channel, from which all adventures are streamed, together with [Jeremy](jeremy.md) and [Brent](brent.md). He spends huge efforts to make the tiniest changes to create a beautiful, total aesthetic that is pleasing to watch. The background, the character presentations, the total layout... Like a true engineer he works his way to a wonderful end result.

# Likes

A quaint little shop prepares hotdogs that Raz happens to adore. They perfectly melt in combination with Raz's non-human saliva.

Aside from that, like any non-anthropomorphic entity, Raz likes to devour souls, open portals, sip tea and revive the dead. As long as people suffer, Raz will always be happy :\).
